**📸 Polaroid Now – HTML/CSS Mockup**
A simple front-end mockup inspired by the Polaroid Now Generation 2 product page.
Built with pure HTML and CSS to showcase layout skills, styling, responsiveness, and UI structure without any frameworks.

**🎯 Purpose**
This project highlights my:
- Ability to structure a full landing page from scratch
- Use of modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, responsive media queries, animations)
- Eye for layout and visual design
- Approach to frontend development without relying on React or JavaScript

This mockup is intentionally lightweight — it’s meant to show my styling and layout skills in their raw form.

**🛠️ Tech Used**
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, responsive design, animations, media queries)

No frameworks, no libraries, no JavaScript.

**📝 Notes**
- This is purely a design mockup — not a full app.
- I normally use React for production work, but this project shows what I can do with just HTML/CSS.
